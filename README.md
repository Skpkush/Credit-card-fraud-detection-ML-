**Credit Card Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning**


### Project Description
**Project Title:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

**Overview:** This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction features such as amount, transaction time, and user behavior. By employing classification techniques, the model aims to enhance the security of financial transactions and protect consumers from fraud.

**Objective:** The primary goal is to create an accurate predictive model that identifies potentially fraudulent transactions, allowing financial institutions to take proactive measures and reduce losses associated with fraud.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to address missing values and imbalanced data. Oversampling techniques were applied to ensure a balanced representation of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

- **Data Visualization:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize patterns and trends in transaction data, helping to identify key indicators of fraud.

- **Model Training:** Various classification algorithms, including logistic regression and random forest, were utilized to train the model, leveraging their strengths in handling classification tasks.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its ability to detect fraud.

**Results:** The model demonstrated robust performance, achieving high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. This reliability enhances the effectiveness of fraud detection systems in real-world applications, contributing to improved security for financial institutions and their customers.
